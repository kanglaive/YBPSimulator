# YBPSimulator
Yu-Gi-Oh Battle Pack (Sealed Play) Simulator - directly creates randomly generated ydk deck files. These .ydk files are intended to be used by Yu-Gi-Oh simulator programs such as YGOPro (https://ygoprodeck.com/ygopro/).

Random ydk (YGOPro deck file) generator, using hand-picked cards which don't depend on archetypes (meant to create pseudo-random decks that are semi-balanced).
Allows for monster/spell/trap/extra deck ratios.
Allows for editing of card id data to add/remove cards.
